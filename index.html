Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a �binary.� Translating programming language into binary is known as �compiling.� Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.<br>

These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
<br>
<br>
There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We have compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below :HTML,python,Java,C++,PHP,Swift,Javascript and etc.
